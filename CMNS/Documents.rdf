		<skos:definition>unitary expression of some realization of an intellectual or artistic work</skos:definition>
		<skos:note>See also ISO 25964–1:2011, definition 2.15; ISO 11005:2010, definition 3.1; ISO 15489–1:2016, definition 3.10; IEC 82045–1:2001, definition 3.2.3; ISO 9000:2015, definition 3.7.2</skos:note>
		<skos:note>The definition of document provided herein roughly corresponds to the concept of an expression in FRBR. A document is a realization of something that typically takes the form of alpha-numeric, musical, or choreographic notation, sound, image, etc., or any combination of such forms. A manifestation of the document must be inscribed, encoded, engraved, recorded, or otherwise imprinted in some medium. The concept of a manifestation of an expression corresponds to the ISO 5127 notion of a document. Documents can differ extensively in form and characteristics.</skos:note>
		<skos:note>The manifestation of a document (FRBR expression) refers not only to written and printed materials in paper or microform versions (for example, conventional books, journals, diagrams, maps), but also to non-printed media such as machine-readable and digitized records, Internet and intranet resources, films, sound recordings, buildings, sites, monuments, three-dimensional objects or realia [when used to carry some sort of engraving]; and to collections of such items or parts of such items. (Note taken from ISO 25964–1:2011, definition 2.15.) Also, software, since recorded, can be considered a document.</skos:note>

		<cmns-av:adaptedFrom>ISO 5127 - Information and documentation - Foundation and vocabulary, Second edition, 2017-05, clause 3.1.1.38</cmns-av:adaptedFrom>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>A document, especially a legal document, may serve to establish one or several facts, and can be relied upon as a proof thereof.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:usageNote>This definition of document corresponds to a subclass of expression in FRBR. The notion of being a unitary expression is the differentiator between an FRBR expression and document in this sense.</cmns-av:usageNote>

	<owl:Class rdf:about="&cmns-doc;LegalDocument">
		<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&cmns-doc;Document"/>
		<rdfs:label>legal document</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition>document specifying the terms of, or provides evidence for, an agreement, attestation, certification, conditions, permissions, and/or decisions of legal persons, government entities, or courts of law, drawn up in accordance with certain rules that apply in the relevant jurisdiction(s)</skos:definition>
		<skos:example>Examples include some certificates, deeds, bonds, business documents (such as articles of incorporation, bylaws, partnership agreements), contracts, certain identity documents, wills, trusts, legislative acts, notarial acts, court writs or processes (such as related complaints and pleadings in the context of litigation as well as other documents relevant to some legal issue), and any law passed by a competent legislative body in municipal (domestic) or international law.</skos:example>
		<skos:note>A legal document bears the original, official, or legal form of something, that can be fully attributed to its author(s), that records and formally expresses a legally enforceable act, process, or contractual duty, obligation, or right and that can be used to furnish decisive evidence for that act, process, or agreement.</skos:note>
		<skos:note>Many legal documents only become &apos;legal&apos; once they are signed and dated, and possibly notarized.</skos:note>
